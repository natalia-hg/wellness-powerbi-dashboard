# Wellness Sales Analysis – Power BI Project 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard built as part of a hands-on business analytics project:

🔍 **Wellness Sales Performance Dashboard**  
📦 **Project Focus**: Analyzing wellness product sales to identify trends across channels, regions, and customer segments, enabling better strategic decisions.

This interactive dashboard explores key performance indicators such as:

📈 **Total Sales Analysis**  
📦 **Top-Selling Products by Quantity**  
👥 **Customer Segment Insights**  
🗺️ **Sales by Region (Map Visualization)**  
📊 **Sales Channel Analysis**  
📅 **Monthly Sales Trends**
